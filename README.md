 work done by the NMSU group


The code file "coordconv_9.c" reads the data from the TXT file... 
The output file from the code is "points_9.root"...
The names of the trees are stored in "trees_file_9.txt"... 
The code file "MUSE_obj_converter.c" reads the root file "points_9.root", and trees' names from "trees_file_9.txt". And converts the trees to OBJ files and stores them in the folder "OBJ_files"...
